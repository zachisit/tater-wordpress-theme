## Base Theme History
This WordPress theme is [forked from] a bare-bones base theme created by Zach Smith called [tater](https://github.com/zachisit/tater-wordpress-theme), with base theme version number 1.1.6. Started in 2017, the purpose of this base theme is to start a new project with the code and coding structures needed to jump start development. This theme does not utilize a parent-child theme structure. This base theme will be updated as Zach progresses through better programming styles and structures. The preferred editor is PHPStorm, hence the existing .gitigore rule(s). An unlimited amount of thanks goes to Max for helping me get this far in my coding ethos.
